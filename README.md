# 30 Days of Rust

Welcome to my 30 Days of Rust challenge! This repository documents my journey learning Rust programming language through daily projects and exercises.

## Structure

Each day's folder contains:
- A `README.md` explaining what I learned that day
- A `main.rs` file with the code implementation
- Additional resources and notes
