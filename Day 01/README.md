# Day 01: Getting Started with Rust

## What I Learned Today

- Installing Rust using rustup
- Understanding Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system
- Creating my first Rust project with `cargo new`
- Basic Rust syntax and the "Hello, World!" program
- Compiling and running Rust code
- Understanding the structure of a Rust project

## Project: Hello Rust

Today's project is a simple "Hello, World!" program that demonstrates basic Rust syntax and the compilation process.

### Key Concepts

- The `main()` function as the entry point
- The `println!` macro for output
- Basic string literals
- Rust's compilation model

### Running the Code

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd "Day 01"

# Compile and run
cargo run
```

## Notes

- Rust's compiler provides helpful error messages
- Cargo handles dependencies, compilation, and project organization
- The `Cargo.toml` file is similar to package.json in Node.js projects
- Rust has a strong focus on memory safety without garbage collection
